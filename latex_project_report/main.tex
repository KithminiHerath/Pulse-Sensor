\section{Abstract}
The proposed project measures the heart rate of a person using optical sensors. 
The optical sensor detects the variation of blood volume at the fingertip.
In our project the sensor will be an infrared light emitting diode (IR LED) which will be on the same side of the finger.
The underlying principle is that the intensity of the reflected infrared light varies on the blood volume at an instance of the fingertip, which changes proportionately to each cardiac cycle. 
The lighting condition in the environment is very important to avoid distortion in the signal so we have taken the following measures,

• To design a special enclosure to cover the optical sensor for accurate measurements

• To use a band filter to remove unnecessary wavelengths.

Based on the refined output signal, we used an Atmel microcontroller to calculate and display the heart rate through the LCD Display.

\section{Introduction}
Heart rate is the number of times one’s heart beats per minute.The portable heart rate monitor is a personal monitoring device that measures the heart rate in real time. For an average person this value lies between 60-100 bpm. The heart rate rises gradually during excercises and returns slowly to the rest value after excercise. The rate when the pulse returns to normal is an indication of fitness in a person.  Therefore a heart rate monitor is an essential device nowadays to keep in track with your body not only for someone who is suffering with heart diseases but also for a normal person to maintain fitness. Having a portable heart rate monitor makes it easy to carry it around when travelling. 
\\
In this project reflective photoplethysmogram(PPG) is used for heart rate monitoring. These sensors uses a light based technology to sense the rate of blood flow as controlled by the heart’s pumping action. This method is less sensitive to motion artifacts and therefore is user friendly.

	\subsection{Sensor - (principle)}

		\caption{How IR LED light is reflected from the blood vessels\cite{epson_sensor}}
	\end{figure}


		\subsection{Amplification and Filtering}
		
		To amplify the PPG signal we designed an amplifier circuit. However we observed that without proper filtering we cannot get a clear signal due to noise.
		So we had to determine the necessary values for the filter circuit.\\
		The typical heart rate of an adult is between 60-100bpm\cite{typical_pulse}.In frequency terms, these values correspond to the range 1-1.7 Hz.So an active bandpass filter circuit was designed to provide the following characteristics using LM358.


\subsubsection{Calculations}
\label{sec:4.2.1}
\begin{center}
	Cutoff frequency ($f$) = $\frac{1}{2\pi RC}$
	
	
	
	Upper cutoff frequency =$\ \frac{1}{2\pi ( 680\ k\si{\ohm}\ )( 100\ nF)}$ = 2.34051 Hz
	
	
	
	Lower cutoff frequency =$\ \frac{1}{2 \pi  ( 47\ k\si{\ohm})( 4.7\ \si{\micro}F)}$ = 0.720484 Hz
	\end{center}
	
	
	
	
	
	So we have a,

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Gain of 10
			\item Lower Cutoff Frequency of 0.72 Hz
			\item Upper Cutoff Frequency of 2.34 Hz\\
		  \end{itemize}
		 To have a low powered operational amplifier we selected LM358 integrated circuit.

	\subsection{Calculating BPM from the analog signal}
	The ATMega32 microcontroller was used to sample the analog signal to 0-1023 voltage levels. Then an algorithm was developed to identify peaks and thereby calculate the beats per minute. We used Atmel Studio to compile and flash the hex file to the microcontroller. 


	\subsubsection{Microcontroller}
	The ATmega32 is a low power high performance atmel AVR 8-bit microcontroller.

	The above flowchart explains the peak counting algorithm with automatic threshold calculation. For calculating the threshold we're calculating the least squares regression line.

\section{Implementation and Results}


\subsection{The effect of noise on the signal}
Initially our goal was to amplify the signal received from the photodiodes. Then we observed that we could not receive a clear amplified heartbeat signal as it gets suppressed by the 50Hz noise signal.

\subsubsection{Without the filter - Dominant 50Hz noise}

\subfloat[zoomed view]{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{50Hz-z.jpg}}\\


	\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

\includegraphics[scale=0.11]{50-dom.jpg}



\subsubsection{With the active bandpass filter}
The initial circuit was modified into an active bandpass filter circuit by calculating the necessary values as shown in \hyperref[sec:4.2.1]{4.2.1}.Next, using the signal generator, the characteristics of our filter circuit from the digital oscilloscope was observed. The responses were as follows;\\ Observation: The amplitudes of the frequencies at the cut off frequencies were gradually reduced.\footnote{The required range of frequencies 50-140bpm (0.83 - 2.33Hz) were passed without much attenuation}

By the observations above we were able to verify that the response of this circuit can be given by the graph below:

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{bandpass.jpg}

\subsubsection{Obtaining a threshold value}

During testing, it was observed that due to ambient lighting conditions and movement of the patients’ finger placement between the LED and photodiode sudden amplitude changes can occur. 

It was evident that a hardcoded threshold value will not count the number of peaks accurately. Therefore, the calibration algorithm which was explained in \hyperref[sec:4.3.2]{4.3.2} determines a threshold value per session.

\newpage
\section{Discussion}
Using PPG we were able to monitor the heart rate with much accuracy and it seemed to be an easy method to be used for portable heart rate monitors. Since frequency of the analog waveform of the pulse that we receive of a person doesn’t exceed 2Hz the sampling frequency of 5Hz that we have used in this project seem to give the most accurate results. 
Noise is the main issue that many faces when receiving analog signals and we were able to overcome that issue with the use of an appropriate active bandpass filter. The most difficult part of the project was to convert the analog signal a digital signal. Here we used a square regression line as the threshold and then counted the peaks. 
We used IR sensors to get the input signal from the fingertip, but it seems that using a green light PPG sensor will give a better input signal. Also, with the use of a smaller in size enclosure the heart rate monitor would be more convenient as a compatible device.
As an improvement the use of a more advanced sensor would make this device output more accurate results.
